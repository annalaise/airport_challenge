Introduction
============

The Airport Challenge is a self-completed Ruby project, which concludes week
1 of Maker's Academy.

This program simulates an air traffic control unit responsible for a single airport.
As in real life, the program is able to check the status of a plane, authorises
takeoff and landing, including the ability to prevent either from happening in the
event of a storm. The program is able to check the weather, and storms will appear at random.

This was forked from the Airport Challenge, so the task and its supporting files were authored by @makersacademy.
This solution, including feature tests, spec and library files were written by me, Annalaise Gibbons, on 8th - 9th July 2017.
